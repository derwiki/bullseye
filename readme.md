# Bullseye!

This game was built for the Lyft Open Platform Hackathon by @derwiki and @awallace

Use your mobile device's gyroscope to move your ball around. Websockets via socket.io coordinates game state between the server and clients at 40 Hz.

Hit the bullseye for a confetti surprise and some good ol' fashioned points.
